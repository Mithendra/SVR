# SVR Indian Oil Service Station — Daily Operations System

Digitizes the paper-based daily operations of Sri Venkata Ramana Indian Oil Service
Station, Ponnur (an IOCL dealer outlet). Desktop application: ElectronJS frontend +
Python loopback backend + SQLite, packaged as a single Windows installer.

The full requirement history and the authoritative design live in
[`docs/`](docs/) — the 20-section System Design & Architecture Document
(`docs/02-System-Design-Architecture/`) is the spec; see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)
for the load-bearing conventions.

**[`docs/02-System-Design-Architecture/IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](docs/02-System-Design-Architecture/IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md)**
maps each of the 12 forms to its exact module files (router, calc engine,
migration, screen, tests) — the place to look when a specific form has an issue.

## Status

**Foundation + all 12 modules built end-to-end** (backend + Electron screen +
pytest/Playwright), each following the Daily Sales Entry reference pattern.
Backend `pytest` **87**; frontend Playwright **32**; `ruff` + `eslint` clean.
Module 12 (Daily Trial Balance) ships **partial** — see its row.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Foundation: migrations, auth/session, RBAC, audit, calc engine, 23:59 IST carry-forward, APScheduler, Windows Services, per-component logging, field encryption at rest, email (memory/file/SMTP) | done |
| **1. Daily Sales Entry** — per-pump/shift entry; locked Sell-rate + carried-reading + inventory-opening snapshot; calc engine; OCR/Excel stubbed `501` | done |
| **2. Daily Sales Summary** — combines both pump submissions; per-pump verification; both-verified gate on upload to Trial Balance | done |
| **3. Rate Master** — Owner-only append-only Buy/Sell rate versioning + change-log; Manager view-only | done |
| **4. Inventory Tracking** — 5 oil SKUs; restock log; low-stock status; feeds Daily Sales Entry opening stock | done |
| **5. Manage Users** — user CRUD, role assignment, per-user 2FA toggle, last-Owner guards | done |
| **6. Credit / Remittance Master** — credits + remittances in one ledger; grouped Creditor Balance Summary (outstanding, pending first) | done |
| **7. Monthly Expenses** — payroll + operational ledger; extensible categories; date-range/category filtered reporting + grouped summary | done |
| **8. Employee Master + Payroll Run** — HR record with Fernet-encrypted bank fields (masked in lists); bi-weekly payroll run (gross/net) | done |
| **9. Payment Receipt** — point-of-sale fuel receipt; rate defaults from Rate Master; Sales may issue, Manager/Owner may delete | done |
| **10. Yearly Sales Report** — FY (Apr–Mar) summary; revenue/salaries/opex computed live; Owner-entered COGS + IOCL commission; CA disclaimer | done |
| **11. Password Reset + email** — single-use emailed link (self-service + admin-initiated); backend-served reset page; SMTP/file/memory backends | done |
| **12. Daily Trial Balance** — **partial.** Sections 1/3/6/7 modelled (SDD §9 formulas; Section 3 pulled read-only from Daily Sales Summary; finalize lock). Sections 2/4/5/8/9/10/11 stored as a `manual_json` blob pending SDD ADR-1. Formula sign of Section 6 litres + density deduction still need a workbook cross-check. | partial |
| CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), installer scaffold (`installer/`) | done — installer packaging is a scaffold; PyInstaller freeze + Tesseract bundling are follow-on |
| OCR pipeline (Tesseract), Excel import/export, external bank-statement reconciliation, 2FA enforcement, Employee Master insurance sections | not started |

## Layout

```
backend/    Python — FastAPI loopback API (127.0.0.1), calc engine, RBAC, audit, SQL migrations, scheduler
frontend/   ElectronJS — main + preload bridge, renderer screens, Playwright tests
installer/  electron-builder + first-run.ps1 (service registration, log tree, migrations)
skills/     Agent Skills — daily-sales-entry/
docs/       BRD, SDD, 14 branded mockups, architecture diagrams, sample workbooks
```

## Backend — dev setup

```bash
cd backend
py -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/pip install -e ".[dev]"      # add [win] on the deployment target for pywin32

.venv/Scripts/svr-migrate --seed-demo      # fresh SQLite + one user per role (password: demo1234)
.venv/Scripts/svr-backend                   # loopback API on http://127.0.0.1:8756
.venv/Scripts/svr-scheduler                 # 23:59 IST carry-forward + daily backup

.venv/Scripts/python -m ruff check .
.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q
```

Config is env-driven (`SVR_` prefix): `SVR_DB_PATH`, `SVR_API_PORT`,
`SVR_DATA_DIR`, `SVR_LOG_DIR`, `SVR_SCHEDULER_TIMEZONE` (default `Asia/Kolkata`).

Demo users: `gsales` / `mmanager` / `oowner`, all password `demo1234`.

## Frontend — dev setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
node node_modules/electron/install.js       # if npm's postinstall was blocked

npm start                                    # Electron app (expects a backend on :8756; override with SVR_API_BASE)
npm run lint
npx playwright install chromium && npm test  # Playwright: boots a seeded backend from ../backend/.venv, runs the suite
```

> If your shell exports `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, unset it before `npm start` /
> Electron tests — it makes `electron.exe` run as plain Node.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` on `windows-latest`: `backend` (ruff + pytest),
`frontend` (eslint + Playwright), `build` (electron-builder `.exe` artifact +
console-script smoke).

## Deployment (target PC)

Run the installer as Administrator. `installer/first-run.ps1` applies migrations,
creates `C:\ProgramData\SVR-IOCL\logs\`, registers `SVR-IOCL-Backend` and
`SVR-IOCL-Scheduler` (`Automatic`), and adds the frontend as a Startup shortcut.
See [`installer/README.md`](installer/README.md) for what's still scaffolded.
