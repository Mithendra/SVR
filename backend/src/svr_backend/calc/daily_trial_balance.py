"""Daily Trial Balance calculation - SDD Section 9 formula register, Sections 1, 6
and 7. Section 3 is pulled read-only from Daily Sales Summary; Sections 2/4/5/8/9/
10/11 are not modelled here yet (SDD ADR-1 pending).

Every formula below is transcribed from SDD Section 9 and the BRD session log
(items 30, 53, 54). Per CLAUDE.md these still need a final cross-check against the
AUG11/AUG12 workbooks before the module is called production-ready - the one sign
convention that is genuinely ambiguous in the sources is flagged inline.
