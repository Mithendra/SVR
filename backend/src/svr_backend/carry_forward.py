"""23:59 IST (Asia/Kolkata) carry-forward of each pump's Current Reading into the
next day's Last Shift Reading (SDD 7.7).

Two policies are required and implemented here:

* **Gap-day skip-back** - carry from the most recent day that actually has a
  reading, never literally "yesterday". Falls out naturally from ordering entries
  by ``shift_date`` and taking the first non-null.
* **Catch-up on startup** - if the PC was off at 23:59, :func:`catch_up_on_startup`
  replays every shift date that has entries but no recorded run.

Post-rollover corrections are *not* auto-propagated (confirmed policy, SDD 7.7): a
next-day ``*_last`` that is already set is left alone.
