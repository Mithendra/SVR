# Daily Sales Entry — formula register (sections 1–8)

Extracted from SDD §9 and `daily_sales_report_branded.html`'s `calcAll()`. Verified
against the real AUG11/AUG12 workbooks in `docs/01-BRD-Requirement-Gathering/`.

## Shared parsing (`amounts.py`)

- `parse_amt("527+588+100=1215")` → `1215` (text after the last `=`).
- `parse_amt("527+588+100")` → `1215` (sum the `+`-separated parts).
- `parse_amt("")` / `None` / unparseable → `0`.
- `round4(n)` = `floor(n * 10000 + 0.5) / 10000` — matches JS `Math.round`, **not**
  Python's banker's rounding.

## 1. Gas Sale(s) — per fuel (HS, MS)

- Blank `current` → `cons = None`, `amount = None`.
- `cons = current − last`   (`last` auto-carried at 23:59 IST)
- `amount = cons × sell_rate`   (**Sell** Rate HS/MS, locked at create time)
- `gas_total = hs.amount + ms.amount` (missing amount counts as 0)

## 2. Oil Sale(s) — 5 fixed SKUs + operator-added rows

- Blank `qty` → `closing = opening` (unchanged), `amount = None`.
- `amount = qty × rate`   (rate from Rate Master; `opening` from Inventory — pull
  deferred, currently blank)
- `closing = opening − qty`
- `oil_total = Σ amount`

## 3. Expenses

- `expenses_total = Σ parse_amt(row)` — each row may be an inline expression.

## 4. Credit Cards Swiping(s)

- `credit_cards_total = Σ parse_amt(row.amount)` (variable row count, ≥ 0)

## 5. Today New Credit(s)

- per row: `amount = in_ltrs × rate`
- `new_credits_total = Σ amount`

## 6. Old/Pending Credit Received

- `old_credit_total = Σ parse_amt(row.amount)` — **excluded** from today's total,
  reported separately as `sum_old_credit`.

## 7. Summary — Cash Hand Off

- `sum_cash = gas_total + oil_total`
- `sum_expenses = expenses_total`
- `sum_new_credits = new_credits_total`
- `sum_credit_cards = credit_cards_total`
- **`net_bal_hand_off = (gas_total + oil_total) − expenses_total
   + phone_pay_not_settled + new_credits_total + credit_cards_total + night_cash`**
- `phone_pay_settled` is captured but not part of Net Bal.

## 8. Daily Summary (auto-pulled from 1 & 2)

- `daily_summary.hs = hs.cons`, `daily_summary.ms = ms.cons`
- `daily_summary.oils[i] = oil[i].qty` (0 when blank)

## Worked example (pinned by tests)

`HS 1317.52 × 105.36 = 138813.9072` exactly — no float drift (SDD §9).
